      ohhhh Hiiiii dija!!!!!üéÄ
      
      i know yk who i am and i just wanna say....üê∫
      
      I know I made a mistake
and I deeply regret the way my words landed.

But I wish you could see past this one thing and the other fights before it too 
the care, the laughs, the moments that meant so much

god plss i wasn't even serious and i didn't realise u weren't liking the jokes

i know i went overboard cuz you just blocked me even ur text abt blocking me i thought it was a joke until u actually did it. 

i purely meant it in a roasting joking way... we always did that too. I'm really sorry 

i didn't mean to hurt you with that joke and you could've just told me to stfu and stay in my limits you were joking with me too and i didn't even think you'll be offended by it.

Blocking me from ur priv account is understandable...maybe..but seriously?? ur main acc too? i can't see ur videos? ur followers count? can't see you grow?? after all that?? Don't do this pls...

 you never share what you're thinking like really if you're mad, sad, annoyed or anything u don't show it or tell the reason...its my fault i should've stayed in my limits. I'm so sorry for not seeing that you weren't liking my jokes.

 It‚Äôs painful to know that one moment erased everything else,

 because in all the time we've shared,
there was never anything but respect and care.
I never meant to hurt you, and I hope you can remember that.

   ‚ú®Ô∏èi made this site to say these things(took me so many hours more than 5 it was so hard) cuz there was no other way 
   
   If you're reading all this wow you really figured out the password and that's impressive lol...give me a chance
   
    i will never say anything to you even if i mean it as a joke..u already know how much i respect you and what you're doing i always care abt you also i always compliment youuuu cuz i mean it everytime.
    
    Even if i don't compliment you that much just know i just don't wanna be annoying cuz too much of everything is bad
    
    so i was just trying to be myself and joke with you like a true friend even started to call u like "tere" n "tujhe" and stuff
    
    instead of being really respectful all the time.. 
    i just acted how u acted to me besides the jokess those were just me being weird‚ú®Ô∏è
    
    So please of u click the forgive button and still dont wanna unblock me -tehamimoazzam35@gmail.com
       this my email...
       
       i could've made a website far farrr better than thisüëæ but it already took me 6 hours and i'm so sick too üò≠
       
       just email me that u dont hate me and its just ur decision to stay away from me....but pls give me a chance UNBLOCK MEEE why u always think of ending it yaarüëπ (if i don't receive an email i'll assume u couldn't read this and text u from a new account)
       
       i won't bother you again just email me once.
    </p>
